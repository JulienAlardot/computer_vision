## Description

This repository is an excercise made at BeCode based on the kaggle Pneumonia X-Ray Dataset.

### The Mission
 - Design a CNN capable of recognizing pneumonia in x-rays of patients

### Must-have features
- A CNN trained on this dataset that can recognize new images outside of the training set
- Proper model evaluation (split dataset, confusion matrix, hyper-parameter tuning, etc)
- Visualizations of model results and evaluations (properly labeled, titled...)
Nice-to-have features
- A visualization of the feature maps of the model
Comparison with other CNN model structures
  
### Dataset used
[Chest X-Ray Pneumonia on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
